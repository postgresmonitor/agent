# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Postgres Monitor agent!


## Process

Please read through these contribution guidelines:

1) Fork and clone the repo locally

2) Create a new branch for your changes from the `main` branch

3) Make the necessary changes â€” small PRs are preferrable to large ones

4) Add new tests and run with `go test ./...`

5) Commit your changes with a useful and descriptive comment

6) Push your branch to Github and make a pull request against the `main` branch

7) Add a detailed description of your changes in the PR with the issue you are fixing and your reasoning

Someone from Postgres Monitor will watch for open PRs but there may be some delay in getting responses.
